  - 318. [Maximum Product of Word Lengths](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-word-lengths) [Solution](https://github.com/jiguan/LeetCode/blob/master/test/com/leetcode/bit/MaximumProductofWordLengths.java)
```  
  Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. 
  You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.
  
  Example:
  Given ["abcw", "baz", "foo", "bar", "xtfn", "abcdef"]
  Return 16
  The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn"
```
