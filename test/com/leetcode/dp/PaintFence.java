/*
 * Paint Fence
 * 
 * There is a fence with n posts, each post can be painted with one of the k colors.
 * 
 * You have to paint all the posts such that no more than two adjacent fence posts have the same
 * color.
 * 
 * Return the total number of ways you can paint the fence.
 * 
 * Note: n and k are non-negative integers.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, k = 2 Output: 6 Explanation: Take c1 as color 1, c2 as color 2. All possible ways
 * are:
 * 
 * @formatter:off
 *             post1  post2  post3      
 *  -----      -----  -----  -----       
 *    1         c1     c1     c2 
 *    2         c1     c2     c1 
 *    3         c1     c2     c2 
 *    4         c2     c1     c1

     * We divided it into two cases.
     * 
     * the last two posts have the same color, the number of ways to paint in this case is
     * sameColorCounts.
     * 
     * the last two posts have different colors, and the number of ways in this case is
     * diffColorCounts.
     * 
     * The reason why we have these two cases is that we can easily compute both of them, and that
     * is all I do. When adding a new post, we can use the same color as the last one (if allowed)
     * or different color. If we use different color, there're k-1 options, and the outcomes shoule
     * belong to the diffColorCounts category. If we use same color, there's only one option, and we
     * can only do this when the last two have different colors (which is the diffColorCounts).
     * There we have our induction step.
     * 
     * Here is an example, let's say we have 3 posts and 3 colors. The first two posts we have 9
     * ways to do them, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Now we know
     * that
     * 
     * diffColorCounts = 6; And
     * 
     * sameColorCounts = 3; Now for the third post, we can compute these two variables like this:
     * 
     * If we use different colors than the last one (the second one), these ways can be added into
     * diffColorCounts, so if the last one is 3, we can use 1 or 2, if it's 1, we can use 2 or 3,
     * etc. Apparently there are (diffColorCounts + sameColorCounts) * (k-1) possible ways.
     * 
     * If we use the same color as the last one, we would trigger a violation in these three cases
     * (1,1,1), (2,2,2) and (3,3,3). This is because they already used the same color for the last
     * two posts. So is there a count that rules out these kind of cases? YES, the diffColorCounts.
     * So in cases within diffColorCounts, we can use the same color as the last one without
     * worrying about triggering the violation. And now as we append a same-color post to them, the
     * former diffColorCounts becomes the current sameColorCounts.
     * 
     * Then we can keep going until we reach the n. And finally just sum up these two variables as
     * result.
     * 
     * Hope this would be clearer.
