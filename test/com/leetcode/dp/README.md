# Dynamic Programming

Keep calm. Write down some cases and find out their rules.

## Sum of subarray

- [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/) - Easy, not so straightforward if you are not familiar.
- [Maximum Number of Non-Overlapping Subarrays With Sum Equals Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-non-overlapping-subarrays-with-sum-equals-target/) - Medium, follow up question.


## Easy

- [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
- [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)
- [Paint House](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/)
- [Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)
- [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
- [Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways)
- [Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)
- [Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

## Medium

- [Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)
- [Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)
- [Gray Code](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/)
- [Longest Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/)
- [House Robber III](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii) [solution](https://github.com/jiguan/LeetCode/blob/master/test/com/leetcode/dp/HouseRobberIII.java)
- [Maximal Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/)
- [Minimum Knight Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/) - at first thought, it should use __BFS__, however using __DP__ is too more faster since unnecessary calculation is avoid. Even thought the ending condition is hard to think.

## Hard

- [Frog Jump](https://leetcode.com/problems/frog-jump/) - little bit different. But if following the description, it should be intuitive.
- [Interleaving String](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/)
- [Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)
- [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

## Cannot understand

- [Split Array Largest Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/)
