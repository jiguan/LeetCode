## Design pattern
### Factory method pattern
Factory method pattern is to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method rather than by calling a constructor.
  - Example: [Pizza shop]
 
### Abstract factory pattern
